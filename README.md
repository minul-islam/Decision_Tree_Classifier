# Decision_Tree_Classifier

This is code to train a Decision Tree Classifier f(2 class) to predict late adopoers using Boston dataset 


The objectives are:
Prune dataset so the sample has equal distribution on Late adopter vs Not Late Adopters 
Create a test and train set  
Plot the performance (Best Accuracy) on the test set for 
    max_leaf_nodes: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 & max_depth is left to None (default)  and 
    max_depth:2, 4, 8, 16
